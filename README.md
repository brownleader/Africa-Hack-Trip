# Africa Hack Trip

<img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/732913/AfricaHackTripMap.png" align="right">Originally inspired by the article "[From Kenya to Madagascar: The African tech-hub boom](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18878585)" I decided to organize a trip through [Africa's Hacker Spaces](https://africahubs.crowdmap.com/). Due 2013. And yes, you're invited. Please get involved/.

The idea is to visit some of the emerging tech hubs and hacking spaces in Africa, exchange experiences and hack together on new ideas, but also dive into new contries and cultures.

## Current State

We consider a 3 - 4 week trip in September / October 2013. We aim for a 
$ 2,000 price tag and hope to cover costs beyond that with sponsors.

Nothing is set in stone yet, your thoughts are much appreciated.
