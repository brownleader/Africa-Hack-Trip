# Africa Hack Trip

<img src="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/732913/AfricaHackTripMap.png" align="right">Originally inspired by the article "[From Kenya to Madagascar: The African tech-hub boom](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18878585)" I decided to organize a trip through [Africa's Hacker Spaces](https://africahubs.crowdmap.com/). Due 2013. And yes, you're invited. Please get involved.


## Objective

Creating the foundation for a sustainable exchange with the emerging tech communities across Africa, collaborating on projects, making friends, changing the world – on hub at a time.


## Candidates

## Current State

We consider a 3 - 4 week trip in September / October 2013. Probably starting in Addis Ababa, half time in Cape town, finishing in Liberia or Senegal. Participants are invited to join the whole trip or only a part of it. Everybody will
have to pay for arrival / departure. We expect costs for the whole trip to be around $ 2,000. Hopefully we'll find sponsors to beat down the price.

Nothing is set in stone yet, your thoughts are much appreciated. 


## Planning Meeting

September 29th, 3-6pm, at [co.up Coworing Space in Berlin](co-up.de).
